# AdventOfCode2023
My solutions to the annual coding challenge.  
The code may not be as efficent or mimimlist as others, however I feel it's easy to understand and to read.  
The purpose of sharing on GitHub is for other to read and follow along.  Therefore I'm putting more emphsis on readablity and comments.

I'll do my best to update them as soon as possible, however with a regular day job they might not get done till the evening.
